Height/level doesnt matter)\n\nThe height of a red-black tree with n keys is at most 2 * log₂(n + 1).\nThis ensures the tree remains balanced, making search, insert, and delete operations efficient with a time complexity of O(log n).\nRed-Black Tree Node Structure\n\n\nEach node contains the following attributes:\n\ncolor: Red or black.\nkey: The data value stored in the node.\nleft: A pointer to the left child.\nright: A pointer to the right child.\np: A pointer to the parent.\n\n\n\nNIL: If a node doesn’t have a child or parent, the corresponding pointer (left, right, or parent) is set to NIL.\n\nNIL nodes act as leaf nodes (endpoints of the tree).\nNormal nodes with keys are the internal nodes of the tree.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeight of the Tree:\n\n\nThe height is how many levels the tree has from top to bottom (from the root to the furthest leaf).\n\n\nIn a regular binary search tree, the height can get very large if the tree is unbalanced (e.g., all nodes to one side, like a long chain).\n\n\nRed-black trees are special because their height is controlled and kept small, even as more keys (nodes) are added.\n\n\n\n\nWhat Does log₂(n + 1) Mean?:\n\n\nLog₂(n) refers to the logarithm (base 2), which means: “How many times do I have to divide n by 2 to get to 1?”\n\n\nLogarithms grow very slowly, which is good! This is why even with a large number of nodes n, the tree stays short.\n\n\nThe +1 ensures the calculation works even when there are no nodes in the tree (i.e., an empty tree).\n\n\n\n\nWhy Multiply by 2?:\n\n\nIn a red-black tree, the longest path from root to leaf can be at most twice as long as the shortest path, due to the color rules (red and black nodes alternating).\n\n\nThe 2 accounts for this doubling of the longest path compared to the shortest.\n\n\n\n\nBig-O Notation (O(log n)):\n\n\nThe height of the tree directly affects how fast we can perform operations like searching, inserting, and deleting.\n\n\nSince the height is proportional to log₂(n), the time it takes to find something in the tree is O(log n), which means the time grows very slowly as the number of nodes increases.\n\n\nIn practical terms, even if the tree has millions of keys, the operations will still be quick.\n\n\n\n\nAnalogy:\nThink of the tree like a file cabinet:\n\nThe height of the cabinet is how many drawers (levels) it has.\nIf you’re looking for a specific file (key), it’s much faster if the cabinet is short and balanced, rather than having all the files stacked in one long drawer.\nThe logarithmic height means that even as the number of files grows, the cabinet doesn’t get disproportionately taller — it stays organized and efficient!\n"},"Mee/Medicine/Anatomy/Upper-Limb/00.-General-Mechanisms-of-Nerve-Injury":{"title":"00.
