## Common Injuries to the Brachial Plexus

> [!info] Caused by extreme over-stretching of the **neck or shoulder**

- This can damage the roots of the brachial plexus by stretching axons within the nerve until many axons break.

- Can also **completely tear** the roots where they emerge from the vertebral column
	- Called **avulsion** of the spinal nerves

> [!note] Symptoms can be similar to other peripheral nerve lesions:
- Key differences to understand the difference
	- Distribution of sensory deficits 
		- Is it in:
			- Peripheral nerve distribution or
			- Dermatomal distribution
	- Mechanism of injury
		- Where and how the damage occured.

## Superior Brachial Plexus Injury (Erb-Duchenne Palsy)
> [!info] Damage to **C5 and C6 roots**
> >Caused by: Stretching the neck laterally while pulling the shoulder inferiorly
> 
> > >Can occur in falls or childbirth
> > >Lateral neck flexion + shoulder pulled through the birth canal

##### Sensory Deficits
- **Hypesthesia/Anesthesia** along the **C5 and C6 dermatomes**:
    - Over the top of the **shoulder**
    - Extending down the **lateral surface of the upper limb** to the **first digit**

##### Motor Deficits
> [!info] Damage to **C5 and C6** indirectly affects several peripheral nerves 
> >Thinking in term of nerves may help to understand motor deficits:
> >> Suprascapular nerve
> >> Dorsal scapular nerve
> >> Musculocutaneous nerve
> >> Axillary nerve
> >>*get most of their fibers from C5 and C6*

- Typical presentation of upper limb:
    - Medially rotated due to:
	    - Suprascapular nerve to Supraspinatus + Infraspinatus
	    - Axillary nerve to Teres minor
    - Adducted
	    - Axillary nerve to Deltoid
    - Elbow extension
	    - Musculocutaneous nerve to Forearm flexors

> [!note] Appearance **Medial rotation of the shoulder** is accentuated by pronation of the forearm
- **Biceps brachii** (the strongest supinator) is affected, leading to forearm pronation
- **Limited scapular retraction/elevation** from loss of dorsal scapular nerve
    - _Note_: **Trapezius** can compensate for this loss

## Inferior Brachial Plexus Injury (Klumpke Paralysis)

> [!info] Damage to **C8 and T1 roots** caused by **hyper-abduction**: stretching the upper limb superiorly
> 
> > Can occur during a fall (catching oneself from above) or during childbirth (arm pulled)

##### Sensory Deficits
- **Hypesthesia/Anesthesia** along the **C8 and T1 dermatomes**
    - **Posterior mid-scapular region**
    - Extending down the **medial side of the upper limb** to **digits 4 and 5** (both anterior and posterior parts, but only medially)
##### Motor Deficits
> [!info] **Clinically similar** to *ulnar nerve lesion* since **C8 and T1** are the main contributors to the ulnar nerve.
- Other nerve distributions (e.g., **anterior interosseous nerve**) will also be affected but masked by ulnar nerve symptoms of [[04. Ulnar Nerve Lesions#Ulnar Claw|Ulnar Claw]]
