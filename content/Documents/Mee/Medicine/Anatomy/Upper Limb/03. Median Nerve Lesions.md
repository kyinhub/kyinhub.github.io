> [!info] Review the course, branching pattern, muscles innervated, and cutaneous distribution from theÂ **medial/lateral cords of brachial plexus**Â to theÂ **tips of digits 1 to 3**

## Recurrent Branch of Median Nerve

> [!note] Prone to trauma in theÂ **palm**

- **NO** cutaneous distribution =Â **NO** sensory symptoms
- **Innervates 3 thenar muscles**Â â€“ weakened flexion and opposition
- **Thenar muscle atrophy**Â can occur over time if not re-innervated

> [!note]Â Innervation to theÂ **adductor pollicis**,Â **interosseous**, andÂ **lumbrical muscles**Â isÂ **NOT**Â affected by damage to this nerve

## Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

> [!info] Compression of theÂ **median nerve**Â in the carpal tunnel, often due to inflammation of the long tendons in the tunnel
##### Sensory Deficits
- **Paresthesia (tingling)**Â orÂ **hypesthesia**Â of theÂ **first three digits**
    - May progress toÂ **anesthesia**
    - Difficulty with fine motor tasks due to lack of sensation
	    - e.g. Buttoning a shirt
    - **Palmar cutaneous branch**Â from forearm isÂ **NOT**Â affected
	    - Sensory deficits are most obvious in the digits
---

##### Motor Deficits
*Can be with progression or sudden onset*
- Loss ofÂ **fine motor control**Â of the first three digits:
    - Decreased innervation to:
	    - **Thenar eminence muscles**
	    - **First two lumbricals**Â (digits 2 and 3)
    - Difficulty with tasks like buttoning a shirt, writing, and holding a brush or comb
    - **Thumb opposition**Â (rotation at carpometacarpal joint) is affected
---

> [!note] **Long flexors**Â are not affected, soÂ **forceful flexion**Â of the digits is still possible

>[!check] **Thenar eminence** musclesÂ can atrophy over time

>[!danger] **Laceration of the Median Nerve at the Wrist Joint** 
>>Produces all symptoms of [[03. Median Nerve Lesions#Carpal Tunnel Syndrome|Carpal Tunnel Syndrome]]
>>>Symptoms presentÂ **immediately**Â (no progression)

## Lesion of Median Nerve in Arm (or Cubital Fossa)

> [!info] Cause can be trauma (e.g., knife wound) or tumor compression

Median nerve can also be compressed in the distal arm:
- As it passes under theÂ **supracondylar process of the humerus**
- Or in theÂ **cubital fossa**, as it passes under theÂ **bicipital aponeurosis**

##### Symptoms
> [!info] Includes all symptoms ofÂ [[03. Median Nerve Lesions#Carpal Tunnel Syndrome|Carpal Tunnel Syndrome]], plus:
- **Hypesthesia/anesthesia**Â of theÂ **palm**
    - Lesion isÂ **proximal**Â to the palmar branch of the median nerve

### Papal Sign aka Hand of Benediction

> [!danger]Â **Hallmark sign**Â of proximal median nerve lesion

When attempting to make a fist:
- **First three digits do not flex**:
    - **FDS**Â andÂ **FPL**Â are denervated
    - **Lateral half of FDP**Â (to index and middle fingers) is denervated
    - **Lumbrical muscles**Â to these fingers are denervated
- **Flexion of DIP, PIP, and MP joints**Â is affected for digits 1 to 3

> [!note] Flexion of digits 4 and 5 is also affected due toÂ **FDS denervation**
> *BUT*
>> **Medial half of FDP**Â andÂ **lumbricals**Â to digits 4 and 5 are innervated by the ulnar nerve
> >>Patient can flex digits 4 and 5

>[!tip] Pronation also compromised - **Pronator teres** and **Pronator Quadratus** denervated.

## Notes on Other Median Nerve Injuries

### Pronator Syndrome
> [!info] Compression of the median nerve as it passes through theÂ **pronator teres**

- Caused byÂ **repetitive pronation**

##### Sensory Deficits
- **Hypesthesia**Â in full cutaneous distribution of the median nerve (palm and anterior first 3 digits)
- **Paresthesia**Â (tingling) with contraction of theÂ **pronator teres**

>[!quote] Symptoms are a little weird, you might expect similar symptoms to lesion of median nerve in arm/cubital fossa but with this, patients usually only experience sensory deficits.

---

### Anterior Interosseous Syndrome
> [!info] Compression of theÂ **anterior interosseous branch**Â of the median nerve

##### Motor Deficits
- **Loss of function**Â in:
	- **FPL**
	- **Lateral half of FDP**
- When asked to make the "OK" sign ðŸ‘Œ
	- **DIP joint of index finger**Â andÂ **IP joint of the thumb**Â do not flex

> [!note]Â **FDS**Â andÂ **FPBr**Â remain functional, allowing flexion of the MP and PIP joints
