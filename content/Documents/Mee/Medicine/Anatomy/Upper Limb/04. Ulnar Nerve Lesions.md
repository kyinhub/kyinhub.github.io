> [!info] Review the course, branching pattern, muscles innervated, and cutaneous distribution from the **medial cord of brachial plexus** to the **tips of digits 4 and 5**
## Ulnar Nerve
> [!attention] One more function to know of the **interosseous muscles** and **lumbrical muscles**:
> > These small muscles balance the interaction of **flexors and extensors** at:
> > **MP**, **PIP**, and **DIP** joints.
> > > Under normal circumstances, this is a minor function
> > > But when denervated:
> > > **Extension of the MP joint** and **Flexion of the PIP and DIP joints** 
> > > *Limit movement*, particularly in **digits 4 and 5**.

## Ulnar Canal Syndrome (aka Guyon’s Tunnel Syndrome)
> [!info] Compression of the ulnar nerve as it enters the hand in **Guyon’s Tunnel**
> >Under the pisiform and hook of the hamate bone
##### Sensory Deficits
- **Hypesthesia/Anesthesia** of:
    - **Digit 5** (pinky)
    - And at least the **medial half of digit 4** (ring finger)

##### Motor Deficits
- **Inability to adduct the thumb**
	- Limiting dexterous movements of the thumb.
- **Clawing appearance** at rest:
    - **Digits 4 and 5** may be:
	    - *Extended* at the MP joint
	    - *Flexed* at the PIP and DIP joints
	    - Typically, these digits can still be flexed.

> [!danger] *Only very rarely* Severe trauma or prolonged untreated compression:
> > **Result:** Hand fixed in claw position with hypothenar + interosseous muscle atrophy.

## Ulnar Nerve Injury at the Elbow
> [!info] Rare: emphasizes ulnar nerve functions
> >Caused by trauma near the **medial epicondyle**
##### Sensory Deficits
- **Hypesthesia/Paresthesia** (tingling) of:
    - **Digits 4 and 5**
    - **Medial palm**
    - **Medial dorsum of the hand**
---

##### Motor Deficits
- **Thumb adduction** deficits as described in [[04. Ulnar Nerve Lesions#Ulnar Canal Syndrome (aka Guyon’s Tunnel Syndrome)|Ulnar Canal Syndrome (Guyon's Tunnel)]]
- **Radial deviation**:
    - When attempting to flex the wrist, the hand **deviates to the radial side** due to **FCU denervation**
---

### Ulnar Claw
> [!danger] Characteristic sign of ulnar nerve injury

*When asked to make a fist:*
- **Digits 4 and 5**:
	- Extended at the MP joint
	- Flex at the PIP joint
- **Digits 2 and 3**:
	- Flex at the PIP and DIP joints
		- **MP flexion** is incomplete due to over-contraction of the **extensor digitorum**

> [!note] With chronic denervation:
> > Hand may become fixed in claw position w radial deviation of wrist
> > > Digits can't flex + thumb can't adduct = hand useless for dexterous movements.

## Cubital Tunnel Syndrome
> [!info] More common ulnar nerve injury, primarily presenting with **sensory symptoms**
> > Caused by nerve compression under **ulnar collateral ligament** and/or the origin of the **flexor carpi ulnaris** (cubital tunnel)
##### Sensory Deficits
- **Hypesthesia/Paresthesia** (tingling) in:
    - **Digits 4 and 5**
    - **Medial palm**
    - **Medial dorsum of the hand**
