A red-black tree is a binary search tree (BST) with one extra bit of storage per node: its color. 

By constraining (having specific set of rules), this tree stays balanced. 
The rules (properties) are the following:
- Every node is either red or black
- The root is always black
- Every lean (NIL) is black
- If node is red, then both its children must be black
- For each node, all simple paths from that node to its descendant leaves must have the same number of black nodes (black height) (Left and Right side have to have the same amount of black nodes. Height/level doesnt matter)

The height of a red-black tree with `n` keys is at most `2 * log₂(n + 1)`.

This ensures the tree remains balanced, making search, insert, and delete operations efficient with a time complexity of `O(log n)`.

### Red-Black Tree Node Structure

- **Each node** contains the following attributes:
  - `color`: Red or black.
  - `key`: The data value stored in the node.
  - `left`: A pointer to the left child.
  - `right`: A pointer to the right child.
  - `p`: A pointer to the parent.

- **NIL**: If a node doesn’t have a child or parent, the corresponding pointer (left, right, or parent) is set to NIL.
  - NIL nodes act as **leaf nodes** (endpoints of the tree).
  - Normal nodes with keys are the **internal nodes** of the tree.

1. **Height of the Tree**:
    - The **height** is how many levels the tree has from top to bottom (from the root to the furthest leaf). 
    
    - In a regular binary search tree, the height can get very large if the tree is unbalanced (e.g., all nodes to one side, like a long chain).
    
    - **Red-black trees** are special because their height is controlled and kept small, even as more keys (nodes) are added.

2. **What Does `log₂(n + 1)` Mean?**:
    - **Log₂(n)** refers to the logarithm (base 2), which means: "How many times do I have to divide `n` by 2 to get to 1?"
    
    - Logarithms grow very slowly, which is good! This is why even with a large number of nodes `n`, the tree stays short.
    
    - The `+1` ensures the calculation works even when there are no nodes in the tree (i.e., an empty tree).

3. **Why Multiply by 2?**:
    - In a red-black tree, the longest path from root to leaf can be at most **twice** as long as the shortest path, due to the color rules (red and black nodes alternating).
    
    - The **2** accounts for this doubling of the longest path compared to the shortest.

4. **Big-O Notation (`O(log n)`)**:
    - The height of the tree directly affects how fast we can perform operations like searching, inserting, and deleting.
    
    - Since the height is proportional to `log₂(n)`, the time it takes to find something in the tree is **O(log n)**, which means the time grows very slowly as the number of nodes increases.
    
    - In practical terms, even if the tree has millions of keys, the operations will still be quick.

### Analogy:

Think of the tree like a **file cabinet**:
- The **height** of the cabinet is how many drawers (levels) it has.
- If you’re looking for a specific file (key), it’s much faster if the cabinet is short and balanced, rather than having all the files stacked in one long drawer.
- The **logarithmic height** means that even as the number of files grows, the cabinet doesn’t get disproportionately taller — it stays organized and efficient!
