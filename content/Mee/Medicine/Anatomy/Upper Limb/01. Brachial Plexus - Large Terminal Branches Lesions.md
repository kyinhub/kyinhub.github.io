Understanding nerve lesions is simpler if you begin by looking at **distal nerve damage** (further from the origin) and then progress to **proximal lesions** (closer to the origin).

- **Distal lesions**: More localized symptoms.
- **Proximal lesions**: Same symptoms as distal lesions, **plus additional symptoms** because more of the nerve is affected.

> [!info] **Proximal lesion = Distal symptoms + Extra symptoms**

### Radial Nerve Lesions

[[02. Radial Nerve Lesions |Radial nerve lesions]] are conceptually simple because they mostly involve **loss of extensor muscles** (e.g., muscles that help you straighten your wrist and fingers).

- **Why radial nerve first?**: Radial nerve lesions are easier to understand and can be used as a template to study more complex nerve lesions.

### Median and Ulnar Nerve Lesions

[[03. Median Nerve Lesions |Median]] and [[04. Ulnar Nerve Lesions |Ulnar]] nerve lesions are **more common** than [[02. Radial Nerve Lesions|radial]] nerve lesions and typically involve **more complex motor** and sensory dysfunction.

Focus: Start with distal lesions for easier understanding, then study proximal lesions for more complexity.
