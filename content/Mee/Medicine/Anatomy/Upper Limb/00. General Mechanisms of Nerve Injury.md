## Types of Nerve Injury 
### Compression
>[!info] most common type of injury
Occurs when nerve is squeezed by external or internal forces
- e.g. Sources
	- External: handcuffs
	- Internal: muscle/tendon inflammation, tumor, scar tissue

Can cause temporary or permanent dysfunction depending on severity and duration.

e.g. [[03. Median Nerve Lesions#Carpal Tunnel Syndrome|Carpal Tunnel Syndrome]] - classic example of compression on median nerve.

---
### Overstretching
Happens when nerve is pulled too far.
Similar dysfunction to compression injury.
-  e.g. can happen during falls or dislocation 
	- [[05. Brachial Plexus Lesions#Superior Brachial Plexus Injury (Erb-Duchenne Palsy)|Erb-Duchenne Palsy]]
	- [[05. Brachial Plexus Lesions#Inferior Brachial Plexus Injury (Klumpke Paralysis)|Klumpke Paralysis]]

---
### Severing
Completely cutting a nerve (neurotmesis)
Severed nerve causes complete loss of motor and sensory function distal to injury.
e.g. Severe lacerations or trauma

---
### Nerve Regeneration
PNS - Peripheral nerves (arms legs, etc) have potential to regenerate.

```ad-info
***==Axonal Damage==***
	Not all axons within the nerve are damaged.
	Some may still conduct signals, just less efficiently = partial funct.
***Imagine frayed wires in a cable***

## Symptom Progression and Deficits
Nerve injuries typically follow this pattern of progression.
- Early Symptoms (Sensory Dysfunction)
	- Parsthesia: Tingling or "pins and needles" sensation
	- Hypesthesia: Reduced sensation (affected area less sensitive to touch)
	- Anesthesia: Complete loss of sensation in affected area
	- Pain: Some can cause burning, sharp, or aching pain esp w nerve compression.
- Advanced Symptoms (Motor Dysfunction)
	- Weakness: Inability to move muslces properly due to nerve dysfunction.
	- Paralysis: Complete inability to use affected muscles if injury is severe and prolonged.
- Severe/Chronic Symptoms
	- Muscle Atrophy: When muscle is deprived of proper nerve signals for too long, it starts to atrophy

>[!tldr] Sensory Loss > Motor Dysfunction > Muscle Atrophy

````ad-attention
```note-imp
Don't focus too much on memorizing which specific type of sensory deficit occurs with each syndrome.
```
```note-blue-bg
Instead, emphasize focus on which area of the skin (dermatome) is affected by a nerve lesion.
```
```note-green-bg
Knowing when and where a sensory deficit occurs is more clinically relevant than the exact type.

#### Example: Radial Nerve Lesion
*Radial nerve compression* can occur if someone sleeps with their arm hanging over a chair (commonly called “Saturday night palsy”). 

Instead of memorizing the specific sensory symptoms (e.g., paresthesia or hypesthesia), focus on the *==location of the sensory deficit==*
##### Sensory Deficits:
**Affected Area**: The radial nerve supplies sensation to **back of the hand** and **posterior arm**.
So, compression of the radial nerve typically leads to **numbness** or **tingling** in those areas.

**Clinical Focus**: If a patient presents with loss of sensation on the back of their hand,
***you should think*** of a radial nerve issue, rather than needing to memorize if it’s paresthesia or hypesthesia.

##### Motor Deficits:
**Affected Muscles**: The radial nerve controls the **extensor muscles** of the forearm (responsible for wrist and finger extension). 

- **Proximal Radial Nerve Lesion (High Lesion)**:
    - **Triceps Brachii**: Difficulty extending the elbow.
    - **Anconeus**: Weakness in elbow stabilization.
    - **Brachioradialis**: Weakness in forearm flexion (especially in mid-prone position).
- **Distal Radial Nerve Lesion (Low Lesion)**:
    - **Extensor Carpi Radialis Longus/Brevis**: Weakness or loss of wrist extension (leading to wrist drop).
    - **Extensor Digitorum**: Difficulty extending fingers.
    - **Extensor Carpi Ulnaris**: Weakness in extending and ulnar deviation of the wrist.
    - **Extensor Pollicis Longus/Brevis**: Difficulty extending the thumb.
    - **Abductor Pollicis Longus**: Weakness in abducting the thumb.

So, patients with radial nerve injury may experience **wrist drop**, where they cannot lift their wrist.

Focus: Sensory loss on back of hand = wrist drop = radial nerve injury
